// bat and ball combined price is 1.10 $,price of the bat is 1$ more than the 
ball.then what is the price of the ball. 

Let's represent the price of the ball as "x" dollars. According to the given information, the price of the bat is $1 more than the price of the ball, which means the price of the bat is "x + $1".

Now, the combined price of the bat and the ball is $1.10. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + $1) = $1.10

Solving for "x":

2x + $1 = $1.10

2x = $1.10 - $1

2x = $0.10

x = $0.10 / 2

x = $0.05

Therefore, the price of the ball is $0.05.
